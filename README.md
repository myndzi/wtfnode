# What?

This package came out of frustration with trying to track down the cause of stalled node applications. Node exposes process._getActiveHandles(), which is kind of useful except it's hard to tell what is *actually* going on from just those results. This module breaks it down into something a little simpler, with useful information to help you track down what's really keeping your program open.

# Note

You'll see that the function name listed under timers is `wrapper` -- this is the wrapper around interval timers as created by setInterval. I can still get a source line, but I can't get the original function name out, unfortunately. Caveats like this may exist in other places, too.

# Command line usage

You can install as a global module (`npm install -g wtfnode`) and call a node script manually: `wtfnode <yourscript> <yourargs> ...`

If you do this, `wtfnode` will load itself, then forward control to the script you specified as if you had run `node <yourscript> ...`. When you are ready, send SIGINT (Ctrl+C). The process will exit, and the active handles at the time of exit will be printed out.

**Hint:** If node doesn't react to SIGINT, it's probably not stalling on handlers, but very busy with your code, probably running an infinite loop.

# Module usage

Install as a local module (`npm install wtfnode`).

Require the module: `var wtf = require('wtfnode');`

When you are ready, call `wtf.dump()` to dump open handles. Note that if you call this from a timer, the timer itself may show up! 

**Important**: Require at the entry point of your application. You must do this before loading / referencing even native node modules, or certain hooks may not be effective.

# Caution

This module wraps and depends on private Node methods. It is in no way guaranteed to work now or ever. If it doesn't work for you, first make sure it is loaded before any other module: some modules take references to things that get replaced/wrapped, so it is required that `wtfnode` gets first dibs on everything.

It currently does something useful under Node 0.10 through 5.11. If it stops doing something useful in the future, please post an issue, preferably with a reproducible test script and detailed version information, and I'll try and make it work properly again.

# Testing

I'm usually all about the tests, really, but this module relies so fully on things that it shouldn't that it's kind of not worth it.
